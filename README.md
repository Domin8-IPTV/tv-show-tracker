as they're available!

## Usage

Clone the repo and install node dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/desche42/tv-show-tracker.git
cd tv-show-tracker
npm i
```

Change into directory and start!

```bash
# starts with lots of console info
npm run debug

#Â starts with redable console info
npm run start
```

TV Show schedule is crawled from an online web and available tv shows are populated in the database: `database/db.json`. 

Edit the file `config/local.js` to **select the shows want to track**:

```javascript
{
	...
	selectedShows: [
		'doctor who',
		'the magicians',
		'brooklyn nine nine',
		...
	]
	...
}
```

Every time the app is launched, checks for new aired episodes in the schedule so you don't have to track every tv show, searches for the magnet and downloads it.

> **TIP**
> 
> If your terminal allows you to create aliases for commands (like zsh), adding: 
> 
> ```bash
> alias checkTvShows="cd ~/code/tv-show-tracker/; npm run start;"
> ```
> 
> to your `.zshrc` file (or similar) will allow you to run the app opening a terminal and doing: > `checkTvShows`.

## Lifecycle

1. **Update calendar**
2. **Start cycle**
   1. **Search for new torrents**: if there are aired episodes without torrent, searches for them.
   2. **Download available magnets**: available torrents start downloading.
3. **Go to 2** after all searches and downloads have been completed.


# Limitations

This project is ment to automatically download latest episodes of tv shows, so is expected to be very alive (lots of peers). Downloading past episodes is slower
and may cause the app to hang, since it waits for the torrents to download before starting new downloads (see lifecycle).
